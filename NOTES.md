# SolidMarsRover kata

## To do
[ ] `move`, `turnLeft` and `turnRight` should be private - interaction with MarsRover should be behind the `execute(:)` method 
[ ] What happens when you try to move outside of bounds of the plateau?
[ ] remove DRY violations in tests

## In progress
[ ] Handle multiple commands

## Done

✅ Implemented initial pose
✅ First move
✅ Rotation
